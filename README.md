# Open Sub Search

Open Sub Search is a little side project I did in a few days as part of a project related to a course at my university and I though I might as well something I would use on a somewhat regular basis.

### What it does:
  - Parses metadata from a given filename, extracting relevant information such as season, episode release group and so on.
  - Searches through a subtitle provider based on given parameters or a file hash 
  - Provides quick downloading of a chosen subtitle
  - Currently only supports OpenSubtitles.com but I hope to add more services in the future.

### Installation
Just grab a binary release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/iboshkov/open-sub-search/releases)


### How to use:
- Drag and drop a file into the application window, or use the "Open File" button to select a file to use as reference.
- Press either **"Search by Name"** or **"Search by Hash"**.
- Select a subtitle and press **"Download Subtitle"**
